"""The index and the two retrievers. TODO 3.

Chroma is a black box here, exactly as the syllabus asks. You put vectors in
with metadata and you get ranked ids out. What is worth your attention is
what you put in and how you score what comes back.

Two retrievers, because block 2 compares them:

  dense     embeddings, cosine similarity. Good at meaning, indifferent to
            exact strings.
  keyword   term overlap. The reverse. Deliberately crude, so it is obvious
            what it is doing.
